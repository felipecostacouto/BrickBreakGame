- #3 of 100 days of code 24-02-2022

- It's not finished yet, i am current fixing some points to make this game works, i have been exploring other repositores to build this game, so it's not my own creation, it's a way for me to learn basic concepts of java classes, data structures and programming thinking, i put the repositores links on the classes.

- as well, i am trying to work in a DevOps project, building a pipeline working with some tools and AWS

- it's been a while since my last commit, i have some projects in my pc that i will be pushing to my github
